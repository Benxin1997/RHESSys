Hi Colin,
       There are three files we need to change in order to use the hourly version.

      1. the clim base file. In my case, it is mission_base_hourly. Compared with the daily one (mission_base), there are some difference from line 14 to line 16, which describe the name of the hourly rain input file.

      2. create the dated hourly rain input file. In my case, it is mission_date_hourly.rain. The format of this file is as following:
         The first line says how many dated records do we have in this whole file. Then the rest of the files are filled with record: year, month, day, hour, and rain (in meters)

      3. the daytime_rain_duration.
        I may change this part in summer to make it more intelligent. Right now rhessys will still read the daytime_rain_duration from the daily input file. It will also calculate the raining hours from dated hourly rain input files. But there are some conflicts when the daily daytime_rain_duration has none zero value. The easiest way to solve the conflicts are zeroing out all the value in daytime_rain_duration input file. I have saved two daytime_rain_duration file, one with none-zero value (use it for daily rhessys), the other is all zeros (use it for hourly rhessys). Sorry it is obviously inconvenient to switch back and forth.

        I will rewrite the related part within this month and by then, you won't need to keep the all zeros daytime_rain_duration file.

Please feel free to email me anything about the hourly rhessys if you are confused.

Best,
